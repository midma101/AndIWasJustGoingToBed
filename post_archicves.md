I'll start this shit off with an album that I've been listening to for a while now; great mix of analog and digital sounding instruments with concise and focused song writing. Big ups to Mount Kimbie for one of my favorite albums of the year. Check the YouTube link below to listen to the whole album for free.

DJ Rashad is able to capture some old school vibes of the Windy City and mesh them with more contemporary genre invocations and newer producton techniques. Also, easily one of the best album covers of the year. Check the YouTube link below to listen to the whole album for free.
